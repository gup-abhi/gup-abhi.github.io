                <h4>My four years at SRMIST</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>After, my first 3-months at SRM, I was frustrated with myself and keep on asking myself - "Why did I
                    join engineering?". But after a year, I realised that it was my destiny to be an engineer as I was
                    studying my field subjects for which I joined the engineering in the first place.</p>

                <p>In my four years, i learnt a lot about many things not only related to my field. I learnt to live by
                    myself i.e. not dependent on others. Working in team with different fields. And many other things.</p>

                <p>I got some great memories from my college life which I will cherish for my life and probably will
                    miss my hostel life too.</p>

                <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the
                    code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a
                    reference.</p>

                <p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger
                    team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
